Christmas in July 2022 Letter: Extended Edition!

We had more we wanted to say, but the postcard just didn't have enough space on it. So here, as Paul Harvey used to say, is the *rest* of the story...

**More Updates:**

* **Micah** still loves his job as a Lead Software Engineer at [Fusion](https://fusionehr.com/). Over the past year, he's seen two of his stories published in [_The Lost Tales of Sir Galahad_](https://store.rabbitroom.com/products/the-lost-tales-of-sir-galahad-ships-spring-2022), run a half marathon (v e r y slowly), and been to several conferences. He's halfway through the first draft of a novel set in the world of _Beowulf_, and he plans to teach a class on Ephesians at [Topeka Bible Church](http://discovertbc.com) this fall.
* **Magen** continues to teach our kids at home, as well as being involved in community service organizations that help lower-income families in Topeka. She is a ninja at grabbing manager's specials, and she enjoys reading and soaking up sun at the pool during the summertime. She loves that the kids are still sweetly dependent on her, but are also independent in ways that make fun activities enjoyable instead of exhausting.
* **Myrick** ran track and cross country this past school year. He also ran a 24:00 5K on the 4th of July this summer. He's always got new ideas bouncing around in his head, and he reads and builds Legos in his spare time. In October, he enjoyed going on a man trip with Micah to Chicago.
* **Matthew** is a fitness buff and is working to get better at elementary CrossFit exercises. He also plays the piano a **lot**, with the theme from "Moonlight Sonata" being his latest obsession. When he's not playing the piano or working out, you'll generally find him tucked away in a corner with his nose in a book. He took a man trip with Micah in May; they visited Nashville and explored a cave in Missouri.
* **Melchizedek ("Zed")** is growing up a lot! He's getting better and better at school. He likes reading, Legos, making art, telling stories, and playing with his stuffed animals. His quirky personality and sensitivity contribute a lot to our family's dynamic.
* **Madelynne** is an amazing helper around the house. She always wants to be in the middle of an activity, and she loves learning new ways to help. Maddie also sings, plays often with our neighbor, Piper, and reads. She especially enjoys comic books and graphic novels, and she makes some pretty amazing art of her own, too.
* As a family, we've been enjoying our project of [visiting every Kansas town](http://kstoddles.blogspot.com), as well as singing through the hymnal in evenings before bedtime. We also read together a lot; our latest book has been _The Lost Tales of Sir Galahad_. The kids liked Micah's stories OK, but they really enjoyed some of the other ones in the book!

Dearly beloved,

It's July again, so we are sending out a Christmas card that is either very early or very late (we will never reveal which). 

But you know what's never early or late? God's provision for us! Over and over, we have seen Him give us exactly what we need, exactly when we needed it. We're grateful that God, like Gandalf, always arrives precisely when He means to. In fact, Romans 5:6 says, "while we were still helpless, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly."

Here are some other things we're grateful for right now:
* **MICAH (40)**: Lots of progress in my creative writing
* **MAGEN (maybe about 30?)**: Really loving the ages of the kids right now
* **MYRICK (12)**: Reading quite a bit of science fiction
* **MATTHEW (10)**: Learning to play the piano better
* **MELCHIZEDEK (8)**: Writing in cursive
* **MADELYNNE (7)**: Starting 1st Grade

We love you all and are grateful for how you've touched our lives. Until next time, we remain your affectionate correspondents,

The M. Hawkinsons
