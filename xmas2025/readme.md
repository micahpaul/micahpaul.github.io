Dear friends and family:

The title "Christmas in July" once again proves more aspirational than accurate for the present correspondence. For this, we tender our humblest and sincerest apologies. On the plus side, you're probably still reading this before actual Christmas, so we'll call that a win.

Here's what we've been up to over the past year:

* Put so so many miles on the van
* Keeps chugging away at her cross-stitch quilt but now has competition in the form of Madelynne
* Has gotten to the pool as much as she can this summer, though it's hard with all the kids' activities!
