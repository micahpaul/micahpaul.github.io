# M. Hawkinson "Christmas" Card 2024: Extended Edition!

We wanted to say more, but the postcard just didn't have enough space. And so much has happened since the last time we sent a card out! Where to begin? 

I guess we could organize these updates using one of our family's favorite games: High, Low, Buffalo. A High is something you liked, a Low is something that made you sad or upset, and a Buffalo is something noteworthy that doesn't cleanly fit either category.

## Lows:
* Magen got hit by a deer on the way home from Austin in October 2022.
* Magen's Grandma Wullschleger passed away in August 2024.
* A number of family and friends have passed away recently, and the grieving has been hard for us and our extended family.

## Buffaloes:
* Our family was licensed for foster care in Summer 2023. We've had nearly a dozen children in care since then, mostly for short-term placements. We've had great joy in loving these children and caring for them, and great sorrow when it's time to say goodbye.
* Micah continues plugging away at his historical novel (with monsters) set in the world of Beowulf and St. Brendan the Navigator. Sometimes he's full of hope and sometimes he wants to forget about the whole silly thing. Pray for him when you think of it.
* We sold our house on Mission Ave. in July 2023. It was sad to leave a place where we had so many great neighbors and memories, but we were also glad to move to a place with a **lot** more room.
* In July 2024, our first long-term foster son got to go back to live with his mom. This was an occasion for great excitement, but we also miss him terribly. He came to stay with us at the age of 8 months in November 2023 and stayed with us until July 2024.

## Highs:
* Micah has loved being part of the [Habit Community](https://thehabit.co/) and attending in-person writers' retreats with his friends from that group. He has continued being involved in the [Rabbit Room](https://www.rabbitroom.com/) as well. In October, he looks forward to attending his 12th Hutchmoot in Franklin, TN. He visits Nashville frequently.
* Myrick looks forward to attending his 1st Hutchmoot with Dad this October.
* Micah looks forward to having an essay published in [Matthew Clark](https://www.matthewclark.net/)'s forthcoming book, *Where the River Goes*, sometime in 2025.
* Micah has enjoyed traveling to several correctional facilities for work, meeting wonderful nursing staff and spending time with remote co-workers in person. So far, he's been to Louisiana, Rhode Island, and Ohio, and he hopes to add more to the list soon.
* Zed and Madelynne were baptized in August 2022.
* Our whole family got to attend the Rogue Invitational and meet Tia Clair Toomey in person in October 2022!
* Matt and Dad got to go on an adventure in San Antonio in October 2022.
* We hosted bimonthly Maker Meetup gatherings from November 2022 through January 2024.
* Micah and Magen got to visit Fusion's home office in New Jersey for the Christmas party in 2022.
* We took trips for our Toddling Through Kansas project in March 2023, July 2023.
