# Things to Discuss, 10/23/2024:

## Notes and reminders
* Canceling Zoom study hall for the foreseeable future, due to lack of participation.
* I will hold an in-person study hall at the Topeka and Shawnee County Public Library next week:
  * Team Room 01 (1st floor, in the New Books section)
  * Right after class (at least 3-4pm; could go until 5:30pm if needed)
* You think the Pyramid Generator was hard? The RPG is coming for you. Beware! It's a hard one. **Start early**!
* **Important**: If you're not caught up with class assignments, please email me to let me know your plan for catching up. 
  * **I am planning to send a mid-term summary to your parents this week.**

## New New Color Game!
* We decided in class that we would re-work the Ferris Wheel project as a color game!
