# Things to Discuss, 10/30/2024:

## Notes and reminders
* Reminder: no Zoom calls anymore
* Instead, In-person study halls at the Topeka and Shawnee County Public Library next week:
  * Team Room 01 (1st floor, in the New Books section)
  * Right after class (at least 3-4pm; could go until 5:30pm if needed)
* It's time to start thinking about your final project! Feel free to pick one from the list on the Assignments page, or contact me if you'd like to choose a different one.
* **Important**: If you're not caught up with class assignments, please email me to let me know your plan for catching up. 

## Color Game 3.0
* The color game is now in its third iteration! You can [view the source code on Github](https://github.com/micahpaul/micahpaul.github.io/tree/master/the-game) or [see it live here](../the-game/).
