## Notes and reminders
* Optional Zoom Study Hall: Every Monday 10-10:30 a.m. Note that we will meet on 10/7 but **not on 10/14**.
* The Pyramid Generator is a new challenge and has lots of steps. **Start early**!
* If you're not caught up with class assignments, could you please email me to let me know your plan for catching up?

## New Color Game!
* We decided in class to start over, basically from scratch, to build a new color game.
* Check out [the game](../the-game/index.html) and [the requirements](../the-game/requirements.md).
