# Things to Discuss, 9/4/2024:

## If You Haven't Sent Me Your `freecodecamp` user yet, you have 0% on your homework!!!

## GitHub Pages
* Instructions for making a website like this one: https://pages.github.com/

## `CatPhotoApp`
* I saved it offline to discuss in class
  * Discuss what exactly the browser does when saving offline
* Questions about the project? Problems?


## Changes to Zed's Colors
* NB: Just for the in-class demo, I saved `easeljs-0.7.0.min.js` locally so there are no internet dependencies. 
  * This is **not** recommended for a production site, since it doesn't pull in library updates.
* Move `style` element to `.css` file
* Bug: When you click the wrong color, then the right color before the sound stops playing, multiple sounds play at the same time
* Sound files: all the color sounds start with 4 seconds of silence
* Allows multiple button presses - bad UX
* No way to guess if I didn't have sound on or misheard
* No way to play the sound again without failing
* Too slow-paced
