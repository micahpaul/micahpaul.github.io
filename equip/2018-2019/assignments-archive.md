| 8/17/2018 |  **Reading Assignment:** "[Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/42891/stopping-by-woods-on-a-snowy-evening)", Robert Frost. <br><br> **[Week 1 Notes](/equip/notes/week-1.md)**
| 8/24/2018 | **Reading Assignment:** "[The Landlord's Tale. Paul Revere's Ride](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44637/the-landlords-tale-paul-reveres-ride)," Henry Wadsworth Longfellow; "[Dover Beach](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43588/dover-beach)," Matthew Arnold. <br><br>**Writing Prompts:** (It may help to refer to the [Week 1 Notes](notes/week-1.md) before writing) <br><br>• How would you characterize the tone of each poem? Are they serious? Funny? Sad? Something else? Give at least two specific examples from each poem to support your observations.<br><br>• In "Dover Beach," the narrator speaks of "The Sea of Faith" and compares it to the withdrawing tide. What do you think he means? Find at least two other lines we could use to help us understand "The Sea of Faith" and explain how they help. <br><br>• List at least three differences between these two poems. They could be differences in rhythm, rhyme scheme, tone, plot, format / structure, or any other poetic elements. Be as specific as possible and give examples from each poem to explain what you mean. Then, think about why these differences are significant. What do they tell us about each poet's purpose? <br><br> **[Week 2 Notes](/equip/notes/week-2.md)** |
| 8/31/2018 | "[The Raven](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48860/the-raven)," Edgar Allen Poe. <br><br>**Writing Prompts:** <br><br>• Many readers have questioned the sanity of the poem's narrator. Some possible interpretations are that he is dreaming, or insane, or that he really is hearing a raven who is a prophet from the great beyond. Which of these theories do you find most compelling? Why? Give specific examples from the poem to support your argument. <br><br>• The poem repeats the refrain "Nevermore" at the end of each line. Why is this word significant? What meaning does it have for the poem's narrator? How do the narrator's questions set him up for disappointment with the response "nevermore"? <br><br>• **Note: This question involves outside research and would require you to cite your sources!** The poem refers to many different characters and places from ancient mythology. What is the significance of these figures, especially in reference to the fact that the narrator is up at midnight pondering "many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore"? <br><br> **[Week 3 Notes](/equip/notes/week-3.md)** |
| 9/7/2018 | "[Kubla Khan](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43991/kubla-khan)," Samuel Taylor Coleridge. <br><br>• This is a difficult poem to read and understand. What are the main events or occurrences in it? Who are the characters? How is the place described? Give specific examples from the text to support your summary. **Note: You don't have to be exhaustive; just get as good a start as you can. The in-class activity will ask you to work with your classmates to outline the poem more thoroughly.** |
| 9/14/2018 | "[God's Grandeur](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44395/gods-grandeur)," G. Manley Hopkins; "[I heard a Fly buzz - when I died - (591)](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45703/i-heard-a-fly-buzz-when-i-died-591)," Emily Dickinson; "[The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock](https://www.bartleby.com/198/1.html)," T. S. Eliot. <br><br>• "God's Grandeur" does use rhyme, but it also sounds different from many of the poems we've studied so far this semester. How would you describe its sound? What makes it stand apart from the other poems we've read? What is its subject matter, and how does the poetic form help to develop these ideas?<br><br>• What is the significance of the fly in "I heard a fly buzz - when I died"? What role does the fly play in the poem? How does the narrator use it to make the reader feel the impact and emotions surrounding her impending death?<br><br>• The title of "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock" positions the poem as a sweeping epic, describing the grand exploits of a romantic hero. How do the contents of the poem compare with this expectation? What sort of man is described in the poem? What concrete details help us to understand his character? <br><br>• Compare two or more of today's poems with one another. Specifically, focus on their overall structure, rhythm, and rhyme schemes. How do their different forms reflect the authors' different approaches to their subject matter? |
| 9/21/2018 | [*The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood*](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10148), Howard Pyle. [Preface](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/10148/10148-h/10148-h.htm#2HPRE1) through [Ch. 13, "Robin Hood Compasses a Marriage"](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/10148/10148-h/10148-h.htm#2H_4_14) <br><br>• This novel was [first published in 1883](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Merry_Adventures_of_Robin_Hood). By that time, "thee" and "thou" [had been out of common use for at least 220 years](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/why-did-we-stop-using-thou). So why does Pyle choose to use this old-sounding language? Give examples and information from the text to support your arguments. <br><br>• The Robin Hood "origin story" in Chapter 1 is loosely based on [a ballad where Robin Hood wins a bet and then kills 15 men](http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/eng/child/ch139.htm). How is Pyle's account different from the ballad? Why do you think he told the story differently? What aspects of the story does he emphasize more than or less than the ballad does? Give specific examples to support your ideas. <br><br>• The chapters of this novel are very episodic (i.e., they are almost stand-alone stories). Why do you think that is?  What narrative patterns do you see repeated in this novel? |
| 9/28/2018 | [*The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood*](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10148), Howard Pyle. [Ch. 14, "Robin Hood Aids a Sorrowful Knight"](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/10148/10148-h/10148-h.htm#2H_4_15) through [Epilogue (end)](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/10148/10148-h/10148-h.htm#2HEPI23). <br><br>• Pyle includes a lot of careful descriptions in this novel. Give some examples of how he describes the forest or the characters. What effect does this description have on you, the reader? How does it help to shape the narrative? What do you think he intended by including so many physical descriptions? <br><br>• One of the oldest versions of the Robin Hood legend is called [*The Geste of Robin Hood* (starts on p. 5)](https://mnheritagesongbook.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/gestrobyncriticaled1.pdf). If you take a look through it, you'll find several tales that look familiar. Another early ballad about Robin Hood is called ["The Monk's Tale"](https://mariahmccune.weebly.com/uploads/1/9/2/8/19282013/robin_hood_and_the_monk.pdf). Now that you're familiar with Howard Pyle's version of Robin Hood, pick one of the accounts from these older ballads and contrast them with Pyle's treatment of the same or a similar story. What different choices does Pyle make? Why do you think he does? What is he trying to accomplish through these differences? |
| 10/5/2018 | Fall Break; no class |
| 10/12/2018 | *The Outlaws of Sherwood*, Robin McKinley. Chapters 1-14 <br><br>• McKinley's vision of the Robin Hood legend is very different from Pyle's. What are some of the main plot or character differences in *The Outlaws of Sherwood* vs. *The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood*? Why do you think McKinley introduced these differences? What effect do they have on you as a reader? Give specific examples to demonstrate what you mean. <br><br>• What do you notice about McKinley's use of descriptive language? How does it compare to Pyle's? How do their different approaches affect the reader? Give at least two specific examples / quotes from each text in your discussion.  <br><br>[**Paper assignment given, due 11/23**](/equip/notes/paper-1.md) |
| 10/19/2018 | *The Outlaws of Sherwood*, Robin McKinley. Chapters 15-Afterword (end) <br><br>• An option that was suggested in class: Be creative! Write your own brief, more satisfying ending to *The Outlaws of Sherwood*. It can be in a fictional style, or you can create a plot summary if you're not as confident about your creative writing skills. You can also create some other artistic response to the novel: Drawing / painting, song, video, etc. - The only limit is your imagination. Just make it good. :-) <br><br>• A more traditional response: How does the ending of this novel compare to the ending of either Pyle's *Merry Adventures of Robin Hood* or the Disney cartoon *Robin Hood*? Why might McKinley have chosen to end it as she did? How did she want the ending to affect the reader? <br><br>• Another essay option: How does McKinley's portrayal of women in this novel differ from the portrayal of women in either Pyle's novel or the older Robin Hood legends? You might give specific attention to how Cecily and Marian use disguises to "pass" as men. What messages (obvious or implied) is McKinley trying to communicate to her readers? What is your response, as a reader, to these plot devices and messages? |
| 10/26/2018 | [*David Copperfield*](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/43111), Charles Dickens, [Chapter 1](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43111/43111-h/43111-h.htm#ch0) - [Chapter 15](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43111/43111-h/43111-h.htm#ch14) (a.k.a. Parts I - V) <br><br>• Dickens makes the reader quite uncomfortable with sympathy for young David (the narrator). How does he accomplish this? Which parts of the novel make you saddest or most sympathetic for David? Be sure to provide specific examples from the text!<br><br>• Names are very important in this novel (as in all of Dickens's writing). Discuss at least three interesting or unusual character names. What do they tell, suggest, or imply about the characters? Again, give specific examples from the text to demonstrate why you came to your conclusions (and hopefully lead the reader to the same conclusions!).<br><br>• I mentioned in class that one of Dickens's favorite ways of introducing a character is to provide us with one or two very quirky facts about them. Explore this idea with one or more characters introduced in Chpaters 1-15. What traits do they have? What do these traits tell us about each character, their values, and how we can expect them to behave? |
| 11/2/2018 | [*David Copperfield*](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/43111), Charles Dickens, [Chapter 16](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43111/43111-h/43111-h.htm#ch15) - [Chapter 31](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43111/43111-h/43111-h.htm#ch30) (a.k.a. Parts VI - X) <br><br>• The topic of falling in -- and out -- of love comes up a great deal in this novel. Compare and contrast some of David's many romantic interests. Pay special attention to how Dickens describes them. What techniques does he use to make us feel David's extreme distraction? How are the various women described? What features does the narrator seem most drawn to? And what can all of this tell us about David, his level of maturity, and what he desires in life?<br><br>• Consider the different names David receives. Who gives him each name? Why? What do these various names tell us about how David interacts with the people and world around him?<br><br>• In this part of the novel, we see more emphasis on social class. Some possible questions to consider in relation to this: How does Dickens deal with money, social status, morality, and other features of social class? What sort of people are the most reliable? The most respectable? Are there other things you learn from Dickens's treatment of social class in this novel? |
| 11/9/2018 | [*David Copperfield*](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/43111), Charles Dickens, [Chapter 32](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43111/43111-h/43111-h.htm#ch31) - [Chapter 46](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43111/43111-h/43111-h.htm#ch45) (a.k.a. Parts XI - XV) <br><br>• Choose a character who is present throughout the novel. Trace their development from the beginning toward the end - how do they change? Does our opinion of them change? Do their physical appearance or mannerisms remain the same? What is your feeling about them now, 3/4 of the way through the book, as opposed to the beginning? Do you find the changes convincing and believable, or not? Why? As always, please give specific examples to support your ideas.<br><br>• Consider Trot's marriage to Dora. How does their relationship progress? Would you describe their marriage as a happy one? What is the general attitude of Dickens toward marriage, and how can you tell? Give examples!   |
