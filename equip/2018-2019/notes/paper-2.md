**Grading Criteria / Weighting:**
[See grading rubric here](rubric.md).

**Paper Topic Options**:
**Note 1**: You may use any text we read in Fall 2018 or Spring 2019 in your paper.
**Note 2**: Your  paper should contain some summary about the text (i.e., the "who / what / when / where / how"), but also needs to include some good analysis (i.e., the "why").

1. **Heroes, Villains, and Other Characters.** Choose at least two characters from texts we have read and examine them. How are they similar? How are they different? What has the author done to make us like them, hate them, or otherwise react to them? How do they behave in difficult situations? What drives them? A few possible pairings: Mr. Micawber and Unferth, Prospero and Beowulf, Robin Hood (from *The Outlaws of Sherwood*) and David Copperfield, Mr. Murdstone and The Misfit (from "A Good Man is Hard to Find"), Emma and Hulga Joy (from "Good Country People"), Uriah Heep and Mr. Shiftlet (from "The Life You Save May Be Your Own"). As always, be sure to use LOTS of examples from the texts!

2. **Poetic Forms.** Select and compare at least three of the poems we've read this year. How are they similar in form, content, or purpose? How are they different? What techniques do the poets use to affect your mind or emotions? Do the poems contain surprising or confusing elements? Why do you think the poets incorporated these? Discuss specific examples from each poem in your discussion.

3. **Setting, Plot, and Style.** Choose at least two different texts and discuss how the setting affects the story. Specifically, how does the place / time / subject matter help to shape the story itself? How does it help to drive the author's literary style or artistic choices? Look for similarities and differences between the settings of the two texts. Some examples: How does the setting of ninth-century Europe affect the style of the *Beowulf* poet? How is his style different from that of Emily Dickinson? How is O'Connor's fiction shaped by her experience in the American South? How does it differ from the writing of Mary Shelley, which happened about a hundred years earlier on the European continent? Why does Robin McKinley take such a different approach to the Robin Hood legend than Howard Pyle does? Use many specific examples from the texts in your discussion.

4. If you would like to write about something else, please contact me with your idea so I can help ensure that it's appropriate for this assignment. Imagination and initiative are admirable, and I want to encourage them!
