Dearly beloved,

It's July again, so we are sending out a Christmas card that is either very early or very late (we will never reveal which). 

But you know what's never early or late? God's provision for us! Over and over, we have seen Him give us exactly what we need, exactly when we needed it. We're grateful that God, like Gandalf, always arrives precisely when He means to.

Here's what we're grateful for right now:
* MICAH (40): Lots of progress in my creative writing
* MAGEN (37): 
* MYRICK (12): Reading quite a bit of science fiction
* MATTHEW (10): Learning to play the piano better
* MELCHIZEDEK (8): Writing in cursive
* MADELYNNE (7): Starting 1st Grade

We love you all and are grateful for how you've touched our lives. 

Until next time, we remain your affectionate correspondents,

The M. Hawkinsons

Romans 5:6  - For while we were still helpless, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly.

Micah (39) still loves his job making pharmacy software. He’s looking forward to having a couple of short stories about Sir Galahad published in an upcoming anthology.

Magen (30ish???) continues teaching our kids at home and running Illuminate Topeka, a non-profit that works with local schools to provide food for low-income students. 

Myrick (11) enjoys singing, running, drawing, and reading. He is a Minecraft enthusiast.

Matt (9) is a master tree climber and has been working on his handstand walks. He also reads a lot and is teaching himself to play the piano.

Zed (7) had fun studying chemistry and physics with his brothers this past year. His other interests include Nerf weapons and eating (especially carrots).

Madelynne (6) takes good care of her babies, most of whom are named Isabelle. She also likes to paint, make crafts, and spend time with her friends.

We’ve been slowly continuing our project to visit every Kansas town. You can follow our progress at kstoddles.blogspot.com.


We’d love to hear from you, so please drop us a line if you want to!


Until next time, we remain your affectionate correspondents,


The M. Hawkinsons
