[Micah Hawkinson's EQUIP Programming, Fall 2024](readme.md)
---

## Class Description
In this class, we will poke and prod the flesh and bones of the Internet. Specifically, we will learn about the main languages that are used to build web pages and apps: 
* Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)
* Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
* JavaScript (JS)

We'll learn primarily by doing, so I will [assign lots of mini-projects](assignments.md) throughout the semester. 

## Who should take it?
The class is intended for students who have an interest and curiosity about how the web works. Familiarity with computers is a plus, but anyone who can follow instructions and work hard should do pretty well in the class.

## Structure
* I will assign small weekly projects to be completed by the student at home.
* In class, we will go over any questions or problems they encountered that week. 
* I will also provide some high-level instruction to students for the next week's assignment.
* Grading will be done on a complete / not complete basis for each assigned project.
  * Students will receive full credit for the project if it works and does what it needs to do (i.e., meets the project's Acceptance Criteria). 
  * Students who want to do more than the one assigned project are encouraged to follow their curiosity as far as their time and parents will allow. :-)
* The topics will be laid out in order of complexity:
  * We will start with basic HTML,
  * Move on to more code-like CSS, and 
  * Finally, dip our toes into the shallows of JS at the end of the semester.
