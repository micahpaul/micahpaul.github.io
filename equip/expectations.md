## What is this class?
This is a high school-level class in creative writing and English literature. My goals for the class are twofold:
- Prepare students to excel in a college English classroom
- Help students to become better at writing

## How can this class help students?
I hope the class will make students:
- **More engaged.** A bored or detached reader will be a listless, unenthusiastic one. The more interested and involved we are, the better we become as readers. Immersing ourselves in the act of writing also helps us to read better.
- **More inquisitive.** Asking the right questions can open new layers in a work of literature. It’s one of the things that separates a mediocre reader from an excellent one.
- **More thoughtful.** I want to help students improve their critical thinking skills, make connections between texts, and question assumptions and motivations (those of the author, their own, and even mine). With that said, I also recognize that dissecting a poem can be a lot like dissecting a frog: The results aren’t much to look at, and on top of that, you killed your frog. So we’ll try to walk the fine line between thorough analysis and overanalysis.
- **More delighted.** My love for reading and writing led me to pursue two English degrees. I want to share that love with my students and help fan their spark of interest into a flame that will serve, delight, and edify them for the rest of their lives.
- **More creative.** The human urge to create is one of the ways we're created in God's image. As we practice creating beautiful and interesting things, we become better at living out the *imago Dei* stamped within us.

## How is the class structured?
This is a class in writing and English literature. As such, I place a lot of emphasis on both reading and writing:
- **Reading**: 
  - I'm asking students to read at least one short story or essay per week. Some stories may be longer than others, but I don't think I've assigned anything longer than about 40 pages. 
  - I give a 5-minute, 5-point reading quiz at the start of each class for accountability and to refresh my students' memories about what we read.
  - Students are encouraged to submit quiz questions. Any who do so may earn 1 extra credit point for the week.
- **Writing**:
  - Each week, I ask my students to submit **either** a short essay about the weekly readings **or** a short piece of creative writing.
  - I provide weekly writing prompts that students may choose from in writing their papers. The first half of the semester will be primarily "English essay" assignments, and the latter half will be primarily creative.
  - The papers should be submitted before the beginning of class if possible.
  - I prefer that the papers be submitted by e-mail, since this makes it easier for me to read, comment on, and return them in a timely manner. I prefer for them to share these as Google Docs documents, but e-mailed Word Documents (.docx format) can also work well.
  - I will comment in passing on mechanical issues such as spelling or punctuation, but my real focus is to find:
    - One thing the student does really well in the piece, and
    - One thing the student could work on or consider more deeply
  - I typically give 5 points for weekly papers that are turned in and 0 points for papers that are not turned in. (If something has been turned in but does not meet minimal standards, it may receive fewer points.)
  - At the end of the semester, I will give a longer, 100-point writing assignment of between 5 and 7 pages. I will allow students to choose either a more "English essay" option or a creative writing option.

## What can students expect from you?
My students can expect that I will:
- Care about their academic, personal, and spiritual growth
- Teach them as much as I can to help them be successful
- Encourage them and push their boundaries
- Return their graded work and provide feedback as quickly as I am able
- Give my very best to them
- Basically, I aim to be an English coach: On your team, helping you however I can.

## What do you expect from students?
I expect students to:
- Attend class regularly
- Do the assignments
- Ask good questions and hold me accountable:
  - Particularly when they don't understand something, or
  - I haven't been clear or consistent in instructions, or
  - They're wondering about assignments that haven't been graded or returned yet
- Be engaged in what we're doing
- Give their very best to their classwork
- **Avoid plagiarism at all costs** (see below)

## What is plagiarism?
Quite simply, it is taking someone else's thoughts, ideas, or words and representing them as your own. 

In the academic world, written work is the main finished product of any class or research project. Originality of thought is highly valued, and any kind of borrowing **must** be acknowledged as such. To academic readers, failure to give credit to the originator of an idea is a cardinal sin. It can result in expulsion from a class or from a university, or even the utter ruin of an academic career.

To avoid accusations of plagiarism, every writer must be very careful to document **all information, quotes, and ideas** that come from outside sources. In this class, it is allowed (though certainly not required) to consult outside sources to help you understand and think about the texts we read. **However, any words, sentence structures, or ideas that come from outside sources must be cited.** That means you must give credit in your written work to the people who did the work you are using.

If you need more information about this, [Plagiarism.org](https://www.plagiarism.org/) is a great resource. It lists the following examples of plagiarism that may help you to understand this better:
>ALL OF THE FOLLOWING ARE CONSIDERED PLAGIARISM:
><ul><li>turning in someone else’s work as your own
><li>copying words or ideas from someone else without giving credit
><li>failing to put a quotation in quotation marks
><li>giving incorrect information about the source of a quotation
><li>changing words but copying the sentence structure of a source without giving credit
><li>copying so many words or ideas from a source that it makes up the majority of your work, whether you give credit or not (see our section on “fair use” rules)</ul>

**Plagiarism is one of the most serious offenses in the academic world and I treat it as such.** If I detect plagiarism in any student's work, I will:
1. Immediately contact the student's parents or guardians
2. Arrange to meet with the parents and the student as soon as possible to discuss the matter
3. Discuss situationally appropriate consequences, which may range from re-submitting the assignment to **immediate expulsion from the class**.

If you have any questions or concerns about plagiarism and its consequences, I would be glad to discuss them with you.
