## Build a Music Player: Step 20

This one was really hard for me, so I suspect it will be for you, too. 

It helps if you break the step down into smaller steps. Also, `console.log()` is our **very** good friend!

1. First, figure out the index of the song you'll want to play.
    - You can use `song.id.replace()` to get rid of the `song-` part of it.
    - Use `parseInt()` to convert the string to an integer.
1. Next, find the `button` you want to add an event listener to.
    - You already have `song`, which is a `<li>` element. Take a look at the HTML you're trying to pull the button out of:
        ```HTML
        <li id="song-0" class="playlist-song">
          <button class="playlist-song-info" >
            <span class="playlist-song-title">Scratching The Surface</span>
            <span class="playlist-song-artist">Quincy Larson</span>
            <span class="playlist-song-duration">4:25</span>
          </button>
        </li>
        ```
    - You're looking for the `<button class="playlist-song-info">`. You can use `song.querySelector()` to grab it.
1. Now that you have the index and the button, you're ready to call `button.addEventListener()`.
1. Here it is, all put together:

```js
songs.forEach((song) => {
  const n = parseInt(song.id.replace("song-", ""));
  const button = song.querySelector('.playlist-song-info');
  button.addEventListener("click", () => {playSong(n)});
});
```
