```js
const products = [
{id:1, name:"Vanilla Cupcakes (6 Pack)",price:12.99, category:"Cupcake" },
{id:2, name:"French Macaron",price:3.99, category:"Macaron" },
{id:3, name:"Pumpkin Cupcake",price:3.99, category:"Cupcake" },
{id:4, name:"Chocolate Cupcake",price:5.99, category:"Cupcake" },
{id:5, name:"Chocolate Pretzels (4 Pack)",price:10.99, category:"Pretzel" },
{id:6, name:"Strawberry Ice Cream",price:2.99, category:"Ice Cream" },
{id:7, name:"Chocolate Macarons (4 Pack)",price:9.99, category:"Macaron" },
{id:8, name:"Strawberry Pretzel",price:4.99, category:"Pretzel" },
{id:9, name:"Butter Pecan Ice Cream",price:2.99, category:"Ice Cream" },
{id:10, name:"Rocky Road Ice Cream",price:2.99, category:"Ice Cream" },
{id:11, name:"Vanilla Macarons (5 Pack)",price:11.99, category:"Macaron" },
{id:12, name:"Lemon Cupcakes (4 Pack)",price:12.99, category:"Cupcake" },
];
```

## Step 10
* You need to use a string literal - ` `` `
* You need to use `+=` for the operator

## Step 11
We're back to HTML here! Remember that all HTML elements need opening and closing tags and HTML attributes generally need quotation marks.

## Step 19
