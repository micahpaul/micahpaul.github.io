Outlining for Writers
---
[Last week](week-1.md), we talked about outlining and looked at how it can help us to read and think about poems. We used an outline to help us list and zoom in on the most important aspects of the poem. If a question or topic was too vague or too hard to handle, we drilled down to the next level. In other words, we used outlines to break a poem into small pieces that were easier to think about. 

Outlines are great at helping us to become better readers, but they're also a tremendous tool for writers! This week, I'd like to focus on how you can use outlining to conquer difficult writing tasks. 

Let's consider a couple of common writing scenarios:
1. I know generally what I want to (or **have** to) write about, but I have no clue how to get started. My page is blank and seems likely to stay that way until the end of time.
2. I want to write about something big, complicated, or detailed. I have a bunch of little ideas, but they feel scattered and disconnected. It's like my paper has been written, but then someone ran through a shredder and shot out of a confetti cannon. How will I ever piece it together into a coherent product?

Would you believe that an outline could help with both of these predicaments? Let's see how.

### Scenario 1 (The Blank Page Problem)

Suppose your history teacher wants you to write a short paper about Brexit. You know from class that this was the decision the United Kingdom  made a couple of years ago to withdraw from the European Union (EU). Beyond that, your knowledge is a big, fat blank.

If you know your general topic, then there's good news: You already have the top of your outline tree done! Now, it's time to sprout some branches.

Start asking questions about your topic. For example:
1. Who wanted to exit from the EU? 
2. Who didn't want to?
3. What had to happen before Britain could leave the EU?
4. When did the Brexit campaign begin?
5. When did it end?
6. When will Brexit be finalized?
7. Where did the debates happen? 
8. Why did the Brexiters want to leave the EU?
9. Why did their opponents want to stay?
10. Were there any specific events that drove the Brexit movement to a tipping point?
11. How did each side campaign for / against Brexit?
12. Did they use any ethically / intellectually / socially questionable tactics?

I came up with these 12 points in a few minutes by simply using the reporter's BFFs: **Who, what, when, where, why, and how?**

So now you have 12 branches to explore. The bad news: That's way too many for a short paper. The good news: Like any good gardener, you can prune your branches. Keep the most interesting or fruitful ones and lop off the rest. 

As you learn more about the issue, you'll likely encounter other branches to explore, too. You may not end up keeping **any** of your original ones... and that's perfectly fine. An outline is an expendable document that you can create and destroy with absolute impunity. It's yours, and you can use it and change it however you want.

As with our example last week, keep drilling down and breaking your ideas into more manageable chunks. Before you know it, your outline will be able to tell you a lot about the paragraphs you need to write and the examples or evidence you need to include. **(Properly cited, of course!!!)**

### Scenario 2 (The Confetti Cannon Problem)

You've been reading *David Copperfield* for three weeks and you think you want to write a paper on it. The problem is that the book is hundreds of pages long. You have many interesting quotes you'd like to include, but you're not sure how to piece them all together into a coherent paper.

The good news is that you have a lot of material for the very lowest branches of your outline tree! You just don't know what the top (and the in-between layers) look like yet.

Start by taking the ideas and examples you have and sorting them out by topic. Try to group them into several different groups. Describe each group in just a few words (or a single word, if you can). Once you're done with that, congratulations! You've got your next-to-last level figured out. Proceed upward in the tree, trying to group ideas together into increasingly large subgroups. Once you've gotten to the top level, where everything is under one single umbrella or idea, you've finished your rough outline.

Again, don't be afraid to poke, prod, trim, and prune your outline as you go. Then, once you're done with it, take the shears to it again and again until you've shaped it into something that makes sense to you. This scenario is essentially the opposite of the ones we've faced before, but the principles are the same: One big idea at the top, several slightly more detailed branches below it, and increasingly detailed levels of branches below them.

A more detailed example is forthcoming for Scenario #2 (assuming I can find the time).
