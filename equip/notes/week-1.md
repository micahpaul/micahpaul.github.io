Outlining: A Brief Appreciation
---
Here's one of the most earth-shaking lessons I ever learned about reading and writing. Are you ready? Really ready? Bursting at the seams for me to share my wisdom? Well, here it is:

**Outlining is like a power tool for readers and writers.**

It took me a very, very long time to learn this, and I wish I had learned it sooner.

I've been reading for as long as I can remember. I probably finished my first chapter book around age five. In our local library's children's section, I was a literary locust in constant search of new greenery. In junior high and high school, I read everything I could get my hands on by Mark Twain, Isaac Asimov, Ray Bradbury, Charles Dickens, and a host of others.

I've also been writing for a long time. I dreamed of becoming a famous writer and flooding my adoring fans with mounds of smart, funny, wise, sad books. (The emphasis on sheer number of works probably came from my obsession with Asimov and Dickens.) I've probably started more plays, essays, short stories, and journals than anyone I know. (Regrettably, I'm not very good at finishing them.)

In short, I've been a reader and writer for the vast majority of my life. But I was an amateur, not a skilled craftsman. I discovered this the hard way when I started college and began to feel like I was drowning.

In my Political Science class, I had a five-page paper due every week (summarizing 80+ pages of political philosophy). In my English class, I had a weekly writing assignment and four longer papers due throughout the semester. In Introduction to Poetry, I was expected to understand and analyze things that looked like no poem I'd ever seen. My history and journalism professors said my papers were scattered and disaorganized.

I was confused, frustrated, and -- for the first time -- very unsure of my reading and writing skills.

It took me years to get back to a place where I felt confident as a reader and writer, and outlining was a big part of how I managed to do that. 

Here's the root of just about any problem-solving strategy:

**When a problem feels too big or complex, cut it into smaller pieces.**

If those smaller pieces are still overwhelming, cut each of them into smaller pieces. Keep doing this all the way down until every piece is one you can hold, comprehend, and understand.

I call outlining a "power tool" because it is the best, cleanest, most efficient way I know to break language-related problems down into smaller, more manageable pieces.

I could blather on about the wonders of outlining and how it helped to save me from an academic slough of despond, but you're probably getting bored. So let's stop talking about it and start actually doing it!

Outlining a Poem
---
We'll begin with a fairly straightforward, short example: Robert Frost's "[Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/42891/stopping-by-woods-on-a-snowy-evening)." And remember: Though we're discussing a brief poem here, these principles also apply to just about any sort of literature you could wish to read.

You can think of a poem as an artful arrangement of words. Poems are normally intended to be beautiful to the ear and so are meant to be read aloud. Poets also often pay attention to how the words are arranged on the page, so poems will be lovely to look at as well as to hear. Poems often tell stories or relates some information about how the narrator (i.e., the speaker) sees the world. This might align with how the poet herself sees the world, or the voice might be a more imaginary ("fictional") one.

The "problem" we need to break down here is the poem itself. Let's start by thinking about the different elements of a poem. Another way to think of this is "What choices did the poet make in writing this poem? Assuming she could have written it any way she wanted, why did she choose this one?"

**Poem: What did the author intend it to mean? How does s/he try to accomplish that?**

Well, that's a bit overwhelming. Probably need to break it down more than that. 

**Poem: What did the author intend it to mean? How does s/he try to accomplish that?**
* Form (How is the poem put together? How does it look? How does it sound?)
* Content (What is being discussed? Is it telling a story? What are the themes?)
* Voice (Who's talking? How do they talk? Is their language simple, fancy, somewhere in between?)

That's better, I guess, but these are still pretty big questions. Let's break them down some more:
**Poem: What did the author intend it to mean? How does s/he try to accomplish that?**
* Form (How is the poem put together? How does it look? How does it sound?)
  - Rhyme (Does the poem rhyme? Which lines rhyme with others? How does the rhyme contribute to the feeling or meaning that the poem conveys?)
  - Rhythm (Which syllables are stressed in each line? Is there a pattern that repeats?)
  -Layout (How is the poem laid out on the page? Is anything about it surprising?)
  - Structure (How many stanzas \[verses] are there? How are they arranged?)
* Content (What is being discussed? Is it telling a story? What are the themes?)
  - Plot (Is there a story? What's the beginning? Middle? End?)
  - Conflict (Is there any sort of conflict in the poem? Is it man vs. man, man vs. nature, man vs. himself, man vs. God? Something else?)
  - Theme (What are the big-picture things discussed in the poem? How do they relate to the story and other elements?)
* Voice (Who's talking? How do they talk? Is their language simple, fancy, somewhere in between?)
  - Perspective (Is the point of view limited? Or does the speaker seem to know everything? Do her limitations affect what we, as readers, know?)
  - Diction (What words are chosen by the narrator? By other characters in the poem? What do they tell us about who these people are and how they see the world?)
  - Tone (Is this a serious poem? Humorous? Tragic? Ironic? How does the author intend for it to be read?)
  
OK, now we're getting into smaller, more manageable questions. Let's give this a shot.
