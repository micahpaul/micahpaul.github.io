Outlining: A Brief Appreciation
---
Here's one of the most earth-shaking lessons I ever learned about reading and writing. Are you ready? Really ready? Bursting at the seams for me to share my wisdom? Well, here it is:

**Outlining is like a power tool for readers and writers.**

It took me a very, very long time to learn this, and I wish I had learned it sooner.

I've been reading for as long as I can remember. I probably finished my first chapter book around age five. In our local library's children's section, I was a literary locust in constant search of new greenery. In junior high and high school, I read everything I could get my hands on by Mark Twain, Isaac Asimov, Ray Bradbury, Charles Dickens, and a host of others.

I've also been writing for a long time. I dreamed of becoming a famous writer and flooding my adoring fans with mounds of smart, funny, wise, sad books. (The emphasis on sheer number of works probably came from my obsession with Asimov and Dickens.) I've probably started more plays, essays, short stories, and journals than anyone I know. (Regrettably, I'm not very good at finishing them.)

In short, I've been a reader and writer for the vast majority of my life. But I was an amateur, not a skilled craftsman. I discovered this the hard way when I started college and began to feel like I was drowning.

In my Political Science class, I had a five-page paper due every week (summarizing 80+ pages of political philosophy). In my English class, I had a weekly writing assignment and four longer papers due throughout the semester. In Introduction to Poetry, I was expected to understand and analyze things that looked like no poem I'd ever seen. My history and journalism professors said my papers were scattered and disaorganized.

I was confused, frustrated, and -- for the first time -- very unsure of my reading and writing skills.

It took me years to get back to a place where I felt confident as a reader and writer, and outlining was a big part of how I managed to do that. 

Here's the root of just about any problem-solving strategy: **When a problem feels too big or complex, cut it into smaller pieces.** If those smaller pieces are still overwhelming, cut each of them into smaller pieces. Keep doing this until every piece is one you can hold, comprehend, and understand. 

I call outlining a "power tool" because it is the best way I know to break language-related problems down into smaller, more manageable pieces.

I could blather on about the wonders of outlining and how it helped to save me from an academic slough of despond, but you're probably getting bored. So let's stop talking about it and start to  actually do it!

Let's start with a fairly straightforward example: Robert Frost's "Stopping By Woods on a Snowy Evening."
