Outlining: A Brief Appreciation
---
Here's one of the most earth-shaking lessons I ever learned about reading and writing. Are you ready? Really ready? Bursting at the seams for me to share my wisdom? Well, here it is:

### Outlining is like a power tool for readers and writers.

It took me a very, very long time to learn this, and I wish I had learned it sooner.

I've been reading for as long as I can remember. I probably finished my first chapter book around age five. In our local library's children's section, I was a literary locust in constant search of new greenery. In junior high and high school, I read everything I could get my hands on by Mark Twain, Isaac Asimov, Ray Bradbury, Charles Dickens, and a host of others.

I've also been writing for a long time. I dreamed of becoming a famous writer and flooding my adoring fans with mounds of smart, funny, wise, sad books. (The emphasis on sheer number of works probably came from my obsession with Asimov and Dickens.) I've probably started more plays, essays, short stories, and journals than anyone I know. (Regrettably, I'm not very good at finishing them.)

In short, I've been a reader and writer for the vast majority of my life. But I was an amateur, not a skilled craftsman. I discovered this the hard way when I started college and began to feel like I was drowning.

In my Political Science class, I had a five-page paper due every week (summarizing 80+ pages of political philosophy). In my English class, I had a weekly writing assignment and four longer papers due throughout the semester. In Introduction to Poetry, I was expected to understand and analyze things that looked like no poem I'd ever seen. My history and journalism professors said my papers were scattered and disaorganized.

I was confused, frustrated, and -- for the first time -- very unsure of my reading and writing skills.

It took me years to get back to a place where I felt confident as a reader and writer, and outlining was a big part of how I managed to do that. 

Here's the root of just about any problem-solving strategy:

### When a problem feels too big or complex, cut it into smaller pieces.

If those smaller pieces are still overwhelming, cut each of them into smaller pieces. Keep doing this all the way down until every piece is one you can hold, comprehend, and understand.

I call outlining a "power tool" because it is the best, cleanest, most efficient way I know to break language-related problems down into smaller, more manageable pieces.

I could blather on about the wonders of outlining and how it helped to save me from an academic slough of despond, but you're probably getting bored. So let's stop talking about it and start actually doing it!

Outlining a Poem
---
We'll begin with a fairly straightforward, short example: Robert Frost's "[Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/42891/stopping-by-woods-on-a-snowy-evening)." And remember: Though we're discussing a brief poem here, these principles also apply to just about any sort of literature you could wish to read.

You can think of a poem as an artful arrangement of words. Poems are normally intended to be beautiful to the ear and so are meant to be read aloud. Poets also often pay attention to how the words are arranged on the page, so poems will be lovely to look at as well as to hear. Poems often tell stories or relates some information about how the narrator (i.e., the speaker) sees the world. This might align with how the poet herself sees the world, or the voice might be a more imaginary ("fictional") one.

The "problem" we need to solve here is the poem itself:

> **Poem: What does the author intend to communicate?**

Well, that's a bit overwhelming. Probably need to break it down more than that. Let's start by thinking about the different elements of a poem. Another way to think of this is "What choices did the poet make in writing this poem? Assuming she could have written it any way she wanted, why did she choose this one?"

> **Poem: What does the author intend to communicate? How does s/he try to accomplish that?**
> * Form: How is the poem put together? How does it look? How does it sound?
> * Content: What is being discussed? Is it telling a story? What are the themes?
> * Voice: Who's talking? How do they talk? Is their language simple? Fancy? Somewhere in between?

That's better, I guess, but these are still pretty big questions. Let's break them down some more:

> **Poem: What does the author intend to communicate? How does s/he try to accomplish that?**
> * Form: How is the poem put together? How does it look? How does it sound?
>   - Rhyme: Does the poem rhyme? Which lines rhyme with others? How does the rhyme contribute to the feeling or meaning that the poem conveys?
>   - Rhythm: Which syllables are stressed in each line? Is there a pattern that repeats? How does the rhythm drive or inform the poem's meaning?
>   - Layout: How is the poem laid out on the page? Is anything about it surprising?
>   - Structure: How many stanzas (verses) are there? How are they arranged? How does the structure contribute to the overall feeling of the poem?
> * Content: What is being discussed? Is it telling a story? What are the themes?
>   - Plot: Is there a story? What's the beginning? Middle? End? What makes the reader care about it?
>   - Conflict: Is there any sort of conflict in the poem? Is it man vs. man, man vs. nature, man vs. himself, man vs. God? Something else? What does this conflict suggest about the poet and about the reader?
>   - Theme: What are the big-picture things discussed in the poem? How do they relate to the story and other elements?
> * Voice: Who's talking? How do they talk? Is their language simple, fancy, somewhere in between?
>   - Perspective: Is the point of view limited? Or does the speaker seem to know everything? Do her limitations affect what we, as readers, know? Why does the poet choose this perspective?
>   - Diction: What words are chosen by the narrator? By other characters in the poem? What do they tell us about who these people are and how they see the world? What do they suggest about the poet's intent?
>   - Tone: Is this a serious poem? Humorous? Tragic? Ironic? Silly? Why might the poet have chosen this tone?

OK, now we're getting into smaller, more manageable questions. Let's take a crack at answering some of these.

> **Poem ("Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening"): What does the author intend to communicate? How does he try to accomplish that?**
> * Form: How is the poem put together? How does it look? How does it sound?
>   - Rhyme: The rhyme scheme is AABA, BBCB, CCDC, DDDD. Each of the first three stanzas foreshadows the main rhyme of the following stanza, which pushes the poem along and provides continuity. The pattern change in stanza four underscores the significance of the repeated phrase "And miles to go before I sleep."
>   - Rhythm: The rhythm is iambic tetrameter (u' u' u' u'). This is a natural rhythm for English speech and could also mimic the sound of a horse's hooves plodding over snow.
>   - Layout: The visual layout is very standard. The only thing that struck me visually is that in stanza four, each line ends with a comma.
>   - Structure: There are four stanzas of four equal lines each. This adds to the traditional, straightforward feeling of the poem. The 4 x 4 structure lends a feeling of well-roundedness and symmetry, perhaps. The repetition of the final line is significant.
> * Content: What is being discussed? Is it telling a story? What are the themes?
>   - Plot: Beginning: A man and his horse are going through snowy woods. The man ponders stopping. No one will notice if he does, but he has things to do and so resolves to continue on his busy way.
>   - Conflict: The conflict here is man against himself, or possibly man against society? He briefly considers stopping in the quiet, peaceful woods, thereby forsaking his obligations elsewhere.
>   - Theme: Work vs. rest is the obvious theme that arises here. There's also the opposition of nature vs. human activity, along with the question of which is ultimately better. The lovely, dark, deep, snowy woods can also be read as a metaphor for death, which would lend a much more sinister tone to the entire poem.
> * Voice: Who's talking? How do they talk? Is their language simple, fancy, somewhere in between?
>   - Perspective: The narrator is the main character: A person driving through the woods in wintertime. His perspective seems neitehr very narrow nor very omniscient. He knows what he knows. He is not very plagued by doubt.
>   - Diction: The word choice is simple and straightforward, without being colloquial or ignorant. It is conversational, though it tends toward poetic in the fourth stanza. 
>   - Tone: I'd characterize this as fairly serious, though the rhyme scheme and the narrator's consideration of stopping in snowy woods also hint at a certain playfulness.

Now our summary of the poem has  meat on its bones. We're even moving toward some interesting anlysis! This outline isn't anywhere close to comprehensive or complete yet, but it gives us a lot to begin working with. 

I hope this introduction to the power tool of outlining will prove useful as you begin working in earnest on the literary crafts of reading and writing.
