Spring 2022 Semester Project
-----

**Due by:** Noon on Wednesday, 20 April 2022. 

**Final Grades:** I will plan to have this project reviewed and your final grades sent out by Wednesday, 27 April.

**Required Length:** 
* Fiction or Creative Non-Fiction: 1800-2500 words (approximately 5-7 pages, double-spaced).
* Poems: At least 140 lines (about 10 sonnets, or a few longer poems totaling that number of lines).

This is your chance to put our semester of writing discussions into practice! You may write one long piece or a number of shorter pieces, as long as they add up the required number of words (for prose) or lines (for poetry). I will read and evaluate your project based on structure, skillful use of imagery, and mechanics (spelling, grammar, etc.).

I expect you to begin work on this project immediately and share your progress with me each week, via either a shared Google doc or emailed weekly updates.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns about this project. I look forward to seeing what you create!
