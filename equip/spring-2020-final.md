Spring 2020 Semester Paper
-----

**Due by:** Noon on Monday, 11 May 2019. 

**Final Grades:** I will plan to have this paper graded and your final grades sent out by Monday, 25 May.

**Required Length:** No fewer than 1800 and no more than 2500 words (approximately 5-7 pages, double-spaced). (If you are choosing the creative option, a few more pages would be fine.)

**Required Format:** Standard [Modern Language Association](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/mla_style/mla_formatting_and_style_guide/mla_general_format.html) format, with these specific considerations:
- Rather than printing the paper, please submit it electronically (preferably via Google Docs) to expedite the grading process.
- Section headings are purely optional; they are not really needed in an essay of this length.
- Your in-text citations (when quoting, for example) should be [in parentheses as indicated here](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/mla_style/mla_formatting_and_style_guide/mla_in_text_citations_the_basics.html).
- Be sure to include a Works Cited page at the end of your paper with the complete information about each source you used, [as indicated here](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/mla_style/mla_formatting_and_style_guide/mla_works_cited_page_books.html).
- If you have any questions, please let me know and I'll be happy to help.

**Grading Criteria / Weighting:**
[See grading rubric here](spring-rubric.md).

Option 1 (Creative)
---

The creative option has two components:

**Part 1:** A short introductory essay of about 300 words. This essay should discuss one or more pieces we have read this semester and how they influenced your writing process. What techniques from the essay(s) did you imitate or avoid in your own writing? Use specific examples from both that essay and your own essay to show your reader what you mean.

**Part 2:** A short piece of creative non-fiction of about 1500 - 2200 words. It should be interesting, engaging, and vivid. It can be memoir from your own life, a description of a person or place that's important to you, a humorous essay, or any other non-fictional piece. It should use concrete images that appeal to the senses. This is **especially** true if you are dealing with abstract ideas. Remember that the physical world is a key to unlocking your reader's attention, engagement, and sympathy. You can spend time in the abstract, but use the concrete to get there.

Option 2 (Analytical)
---

**Note 1**: You may use any texts we read in Fall 2019 or Spring 2020 in your paper. However, you **must** include at least one work from Spring 2020.

**Note 2**: Your  paper may contain some brief summary of the text (i.e., the "who / what / when / where"), but its main focus should be good analysis (i.e., the "why" and "how").

**Note 3**: If you want to write about something outside of these options, you may certainly do so. However, please discuss your topic with me ahead of time so I can help you ensure that it is appropriate for this paper.

**Prompt 1 - Are You Serious?**

This semester, we've read some essays with very serious tones and others that are more playful. Select one more serious essay and one more playful one. Compare and contrast the authors' aims. What is each trying to accomplish? How does the tone of the essay help them to do that? Give specific examples from each essay to explain your observations.

**Prompt 2 - The World as Best I Remember It**

Memory and history are complicated. They become even more complicated when we shape them into a piece of literature. Pick two pieces we've read that deal with memory. How does each author treat historical facts? How exact are their recollections? What strategies do they use to invite their readers into their memories? Use specific examples from each piece to support your claims.

**Prompt 3 - In Search of Culture**

Each piece we've read this year is written by someone in a distinct cultural and historical moment. They are writing from different locations, social classes, belief systems, and experiences. Even their views of beauty and truth are wildly varied. Discuss two works we've read in terms of the culture that the author was writing from. What assumptions or experiences do they share? How do they see the world similarly? How do they see it differently? Be sure to use specific examples in your discussion.
