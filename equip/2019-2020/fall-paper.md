Fall 2019 Semester Paper
-----

**Due by:** Noon on Monday, 25 November 2019. 

**Final Grades:** I will plan to have this paper graded and your final grades sent out by Monday, 9 December.

**Required Length:** No fewer than 1800 and no more than 2500 words (approximately 5-7 pages, double-spaced). (If you are choosing the creative option, a few more pages would be fine.)

**Required Format:** Standard [Modern Language Association](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/mla_style/mla_formatting_and_style_guide/mla_general_format.html) format, with these specific considerations:
- Rather than printing the paper, please submit it electronically (preferably via Google Docs) to expedite the grading process.
- Section headings are purely optional; they are not really needed in an essay of this length.
- Your in-text citations (when quoting, for example) should be [in parentheses as indicated here](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/mla_style/mla_formatting_and_style_guide/mla_in_text_citations_the_basics.html).
- Be sure to include a Works Cited page at the end of your paper with the complete information about each source you used, [as indicated here](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/mla_style/mla_formatting_and_style_guide/mla_works_cited_page_books.html).
- If you have any questions, please let me know and I'll be happy to help.

**Grading Criteria / Weighting:**
[See grading rubric here](fall-rubric.md).

Option 1 (Creative)
---

The creative option has two components:

**Part 1:** A short introductory essay of about 300 words. This essay should discuss one or more stories we have read this semester and how they influenced your writing process. What techniques from the story(ies) did you imitate or avoid in your own writing? Use specific examples from both that story and your own story to show your reader what you mean.

**Part 2:** A short story of about 1500 - 2200 words. It should be interesting, engaging, and vivid. Show your reader the world you've imagined, and invite us in to experience it with as many of our senses as possible. The characters should be fully imagined and embodied in the story, the plot should be entertaining, and the dialogue should be believable.

Option 2 (Analytical)
---

**Note 1**: You may use any text we read in Fall 2019 in your paper.

**Note 2**: Your  paper may contain some brief summary of the text (i.e., the "who / what / when / where"), but its main focus should be good analysis (i.e., the "why" and "how").

**Note 3**: If you want to write about something outside of these options, you may certainly do so. However, please discuss your topic with me ahead of time so I can help you ensure that it is appropriate for this paper.

1. **Ladies and... Ladies.** Pick two or three female characters to compare and contrast in the stories we've read this semester. Some possibilities: Margaret Kirby, the main character in "Arrangement in Black and White," Mathilde in "The Necklace," Julie or Jim Kendall's wife in "Haircut," Pahom's wife or sister-in-law in "How Much Land Does a Man Need?", Asbury's mother in "The Enduring Chill," Mrs. White in "The Monkey's Paw," or Mrs. Mallard in "The Story of an Hour." How are the women portrayed in these stories? How are they strong? Weak? Wise? Foolish? Are they painted sympathetically? How are they acted on by other characters or the demands that society places on them? What purpose do they serve in the story? How are their roles or purposes different from those of men in the same story?

2. **Death and Other Details.** Many of the stories we've read have dealt with death. Using two or three of the stories, discuss how various authors or characters releate to death. Do they fear it? Avoid it? Accept it? Why? What kind of language is used in talking about death? How vivid are the descriptions of death, and how does their vividness affect the reader?

3. **Well, That's Funny!** Several of the stories we've read have various levels of humor, ranging from subtle irony to outlandish tall tales. Pick two or three of the stories that you found funniest. What makes them funny? What details are especially useful in building the humor of the stories? What purpose do you think the authors had in including these funny elements in the story? What effect do they have on the reader?
