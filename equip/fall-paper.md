Fall 2019 Semester Paper
-----

**Due by:** Noon on Monday, 25 November 2019. I will plan to have the paper graded and your final grades sent out by Monday, 9 December.

**Required Length:** No fewer than 1800 and no more than 2500 words (approximately 5-7 pages, double-spaced). (If you are choosing the creative option, a few more pages would be fine.)

**Required Format:** Standard [Modern Language Association](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/mla_style/mla_formatting_and_style_guide/mla_general_format.html) format, with these specific considerations:
- Rather than printing the paper, please submit it electronically (preferably via Google Docs) to expedite the grading process.
- Section headings are purely optional; they are not really needed in an essay of this length.
- Your in-text citations (when quoting, for example) should be [in parentheses as indicated here](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/mla_style/mla_formatting_and_style_guide/mla_in_text_citations_the_basics.html).
- Be sure to include a Works Cited page at the end of your paper with the complete information about each source you used, [as indicated here](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/mla_style/mla_formatting_and_style_guide/mla_works_cited_page_books.html).
- If you have any questions, please let me know and I'll be happy to help.

**Grading Criteria / Weighting:**
[See grading rubric here](fall-rubric.md).

Option 1 (Creative)
---

The creative option has two components:

**Part 1:** A short introductory essay of about 300 words. This essay should discuss one or more stories we have read this semester and how they influenced your writing process. What techniques from the story(ies) did you imitate or avoid in your own writing? Use specific examples from both that story and your own story to show your reader what you mean.

**Part 2:** A short story of about 1500 - 2200 words. It should be interesting, engaging, and vivid. Show your reader the world you've imagined, and invite us in to experience it with as many of our senses as possible. The characters should be fully imagined and embodied in the story, the plot should be interesting, and the dialogue should be believable.

Option 2 (Analytical)
---

**Note 1**: You may use any text we read in Fall 2019 in your paper.

**Note 2**: Your  paper may contain some brief summary of the text (i.e., the "who / what / when / where"), but its main focus should be good analysis (i.e., the "why" and "how").

**Note 3**: If you want to write about something outside of these options, you may certainly do so. However, please discuss your topic with me ahead of time so I can help you ensure that it is appropriate for this paper.

1. **The Problems of Women.** 

2. **Poetic Forms.** Select and compare at least three of the poems we've read this year. How are they similar in form, content, or purpose? How are they different? What techniques do the poets use to affect your mind or emotions? Do the poems contain surprising or confusing elements? Why do you think the poets incorporated these? Discuss specific examples from each poem in your discussion.

3. **Setting, Plot, and Style.** Choose at least two different texts and discuss how the setting affects the story. Specifically, how does the place / time / subject matter help to shape the story itself? How does it help to drive the author's literary style or artistic choices? Look for similarities and differences between the settings of the two texts. Some examples: How does the setting of ninth-century Europe affect the style of the *Beowulf* poet? How is his style different from that of Emily Dickinson? How is O'Connor's fiction shaped by her experience in the American South? How does it differ from the writing of Mary Shelley, which happened about a hundred years earlier on the European continent? Why does Robin McKinley take such a different approach to the Robin Hood legend than Howard Pyle does? Use many specific examples from the texts in your discussion.

4. If you would like to write about something else, please contact me with your idea so I can help ensure that it's appropriate for this assignment. Imagination and initiative are admirable, and I want to encourage them!
