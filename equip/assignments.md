| 1/4/2019 | [*The Tempest*](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23042), William Shakespeare. [Act I, Scene 1](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/23042/23042-h/23042-h.htm#sceneI_1) - [Act II, Scene 2](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/23042/23042-h/23042-h.htm#sceneII_2) <br>• Give a portrait of one of the characters in the play. What do their lines and actions show us about their character? How do they relate to other characters? What motivates them? For example: Prospero, Miranda, Ferdinand, or Antonio.<br>• View the first couple of scenes in at least two different video versions. How do the productions differ? What choices did the different directors or producers make in staging them? How do these choices affect the audience's experience of the play? |
| 1/11/2019 | [*The Tempest*](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23042), William Shakespeare. [Act III, Scene 1](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/23042/23042-h/23042-h.htm#sceneIII_1) - [Act 5, Scene 1 and Epilogue](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/23042/23042-h/23042-h.htm#sceneV_1) (end) <br>• Either individually or with other class members, choose a scene from *The Tempest* to read in class. Target time: 3-5 minutes. The purpose is to see and hear these lines, which were really meant to be experienced live rather than simply read. <br>• Caliban and Ariel are interesting characters that share a lot in common but also are quite different. Discuss their similarities and differences. Why does Shakespeare include each of them in the play? And what does their presence imply about the island, if anything?<br>• Consider the fitness of various characters to rule. Which one would make the best ruler of a city, and why? Do you think Prospero would be a good duke? Discuss, using examples from the play. |
| 1/18/2019 | [*Emma*](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/158), Jane Austen. [Vol. 1 Ch. 1](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/158/158-h/158-h.htm#link2H_4_0001) - [Vol. 2 Ch. 10](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/158/158-h/158-h.htm#link2HCH0028) <br>• Who's worse? Dora (and Jip, of course) from *David Copperfield* or Emma from *Emma*? Explain why you think so and include quotes from both texts to explain your reasoning.<br>• Austen frequently uses dramatic irony in *Emma*. (According to Google, dramatic irony is "a literary technique, originally used in Greek tragedy, by which the full significance of a character's words or actions are clear to the audience or reader although unknown to the character.") Discuss one or more scenes where this occurs. Who is unaware of the full significance of her or his words? How does the reader respond to these examples? What did the author intend to accomplish by including this dramatic irony? Use specific quotes from the book! <br>• Compare and contrast two characters in the book. How are they different? How are they similar? What techniques does Austen use to help us see their personalities? Use specific quotes to illustrate your observations.  |
| 1/25/2019 |  [*Emma*](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/158), Jane Austen. [Vol. 2 Ch. 11](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/158/158-h/158-h.htm#link2HCH0029) - [Vol. 3 Ch. 19 (end)](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/158/158-h/158-h.htm#link2HCH0055) <br>• Has your opinion of Emma changed over the course of the novel? If so, when and how? What plot or narrative elements contributed to this change? Discuss specific quotes from the novel in your answer.<br>• Do you find the ending satisfying? Unsatisfying? Believable? Unbelievable? In short, how do you feel about Austen's wrapping up of the novel? Is there anything you'd like to see different? Give specific examples in your response. |
| 2/1/2019 | ["Miniver Cheevy"](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44978/miniver-cheevy), by E. A. Robinson; ["Harlem"](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46548/harlem) by Langston Hughes; ["In a Station of the Metro"](https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/station-metro) by Ezra Pound; ["Oread"](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48186/oread) by H.D.; ["This is Just to Say"](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/56159/this-is-just-to-say) by William Carlos Williams; ["To An Intra-Mural Rat"](https://www.bartleby.com/300/453.html) by Marianne Moore. <br>• Instead of a quiz, please bring one of the following to class: <br>1) Some brief background info on one of the poets we read, <br>2) A poem to read (other than the ones we read for class), OR <br>3) Something else related to poetry that would interest the class. <br>• Choose two poems to discuss. How are their forms, themes, or techniques similar? How are they different? How do these similarities and differences affect the reader? Use specific examples from the poems to show your reader what you mean.<br>• Pick at least one poem from today. How does it differ from one or more poems we read previously? Why do you think the poet departed from more traditional poetic forms? What does the poet hope to gain? Use specific examples and quotes to demonstrate your ideas.
| 2/8/2019 | [*Frankenstein*](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/84), Mary B. Shelley. [Letter 1](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/84/84-h/84-h.htm#letter1) - [Chapter 12](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/84/84-h/84-h.htm#chap12) (Ch. 12 may be numbered as vol. 2, chapter 4, depending on edition) <br>• The narrative has many layers: The main narrator is an Arctic explorer, writing a letter to his sister, to communicate the account of a scientist, who for in turn reports the words of the monstrous daemon he created. Why might the author use such a layered approach? What advantage does it offer her? How does it affect us as readers? <br>• Frankenstein says of his parents, "I was their plaything and their idol, and something better—their child, the innocent and helpless creature bestowed on them by Heaven, whom to bring up to good, and whose future lot it was in their hands to direct to happiness or misery, according as they fulfilled their duties towards me. With this deep consciousness of what they owed towards the being to which they had given life, added to the active spirit of tenderness that animated both, it may be imagined that while during every hour of my infant life I received a lesson of patience, of charity, and of self-control, I was so guided by a silken cord that all seemed but one train of enjoyment to me." How does this passage also apply to Frankenstein's own relationship to the monster he has created? |
| 2/15/2019 | [*Frankenstein*](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/84), Mary B. Shelley. [Chapter 13](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/84/84-h/84-h.htm#chap13) - [Chapter 24 (end)](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/84/84-h/84-h.htm#chap24) <br>• How would you describe the novel's attitude toward science? What do the various narrators have to say about scientific pursuits? What are the differences in how they view science? Do you think Shelley is generally in favor of or opposed to scientific discovery and developments? Use specific quotes from the text to support your conclusions.<br>• In what ways is the monster or "daemon" like a human? In what ways is he non-human? What are some moral questions raised by his existence? Use specific quotes from the novel in your discussion.<br>• The daemon bears some similarities to other characters we've studied this year. Who does he remind you of? Why? Use quotes from both texts to illustrate your observations. <br>**Paper assignment given, due 4/12** |
| 2/22/2019 |  *Beowulf*, Seamus Heaney trans. (or [this online version by Benjamin Slade](http://www.heorot.dk/beowulf-rede-text.html)), lines 1-1599 <br>• What similarities do you see between Grendel and Frankenstein's monster? How are they different, and why? Give specific examples from each text to support your observations.<br>• Many long sections of the poem deal with other legends or historical tales -- for example, lines 1068-1161. What do you make of these? Why might they be included in the narrative? What do they add to the tale of Beowulf? How does the modern reader respond to them? Give examples from the text in your discussion. |

| 3/8/2019 | *Beowulf*, Seamus Heaney trans., lines 1600-3182 (end) <br>• What elements make up a hero in the mind of the *Beowulf* poet? What motivates him? How does he see the world? Use specific examples from the text to support your observations.<br>• How is the dragon different from Beowulf's previous challenges of the sea monsters, Grendel, and Grendel's mother? How is it similar? And what does this lead the reader to conclude about Beowulf the hero? Use specific examples from the text to discuss.<br>• Discuss the concept of loyalty in *Beowulf*. Who is obligated to be loyal to whom? Why? What are the rewards for loyalty in this poem? Use specific examples from the text in your discussion. |
| 3/15/2019 | *Beowulf* (Graphic Novel), Gareth Hinds. (ISBN: 978-0-7636-3023-2) <br>• Hinds incorporates drawings of constellations in some of his pictures. Why do you think he might have done this? What does it contribute to the story? How does it affect your experience as a reader?<br>• The three sections of the story are told using different artistic styles / color choices. What effect does this have on your reading? Does it change how you see the story? Why do you think Hinds made this artistic decision? |
