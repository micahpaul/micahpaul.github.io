| 1/4/2019 | [*The Tempest*](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23042), William Shakespeare. [Act I, Scene 1](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/23042/23042-h/23042-h.htm#sceneI_1) - [Act II, Scene 2](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/23042/23042-h/23042-h.htm#sceneII_2) <br>• Give a portrait of one of the characters in the play. What do their lines and actions show us about their character? How do they relate to other characters? What motivates them? For example: Prospero, Miranda, Ferdinand, or Antonio.<br>• View the first couple of scenes in at least two different video versions. How do the productions differ? What choices did the different directors or producers make in staging them? How do these choices affect the audience's experience of the play? |
| 1/11/2019 | [*The Tempest*](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23042), William Shakespeare. [Act III, Scene 1](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/23042/23042-h/23042-h.htm#sceneIII_1) - [Act 5, Scene 1 and Epilogue](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/23042/23042-h/23042-h.htm#sceneV_1) (end) <br>• Either individually or with other class members, choose a scene from *The Tempest* to read in class. Target time: 3-5 minutes. The purpose is to see and hear these lines, which were really meant to be experienced live rather than simply read. <br>• Caliban and Ariel are interesting characters that share a lot in common but also are quite different. Discuss their similarities and differences. Why does Shakespeare include each of them in the play? And what does their presence imply about the island, if anything?<br>• Consider the fitness of various characters to rule. Which one would make the best ruler of a city, and why? Do you think Prospero would be a good duke? Discuss, using examples from the play. |
| 1/18/2019 | [*Emma*](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/158), Jane Austen. [Vol. 1 Ch. 1](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/158/158-h/158-h.htm#link2H_4_0001) - [Vol. 2 Ch. 10](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/158/158-h/158-h.htm#link2HCH0028) <br>• Who's worse? Dora (and Jip, of course) from *David Copperfield* or Emma from *Emma*? Explain why you think so and include quotes from both texts to explain your reasoning.<br>• Austen frequently uses dramatic irony in *Emma*. (According to Google, dramatic irony is "a literary technique, originally used in Greek tragedy, by which the full significance of a character's words or actions are clear to the audience or reader although unknown to the character.") Discuss one or more scenes where this occurs. Who is unaware of the full significance of her or his words? How does the reader respond to these examples? What did the author intend to accomplish by including this dramatic irony? Use specific quotes from the book! <br>• Compare and contrast two characters in the book. How are they different? How are they similar? What techniques does Austen use to help us see their personalities? Use specific quotes to illustrate your observations.  |
| 1/25/2019 |  [*Emma*](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/158), Jane Austen. [Vol. 2 Ch. 11](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/158/158-h/158-h.htm#link2HCH0029) - [Vol. 3 Ch. 19 (end)](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/158/158-h/158-h.htm#link2HCH0055) <br>• Has your opinion of Emma changed over the course of the novel? If so, when and how? What plot or narrative elements contributed to this change? Discuss specific quotes from the novel in your answer.<br>• Do you find the ending satisfying? Unsatisfying? Believable? Unbelievable? In short, how do you feel about Austen's wrapping up of the novel? Is there anything you'd like to see different? Give specific examples in your response. |
| 2/1/2019 | ["Miniver Cheevy"](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44978/miniver-cheevy), by E. A.

How are their forms, themes, or techniques similar? How are they different? How do these similarities and differences affect the reader? Use specific examples from the poems to show your reader what you mean.<br>• Pick at least one poem from today. How does it differ from one or more poems we read previously? Why do you think the poet departed from more traditional poetic forms? What does the poet hope to gain? Use specific examples and quotes to demonstrate your ideas.
