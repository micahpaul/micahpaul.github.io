[Micah Hawkinson's EQUIP Programming, Spring 2025](readme.md)
---

This schedule shows the minimum work that must be completed during the semester. You may move more quickly and get more done if you have the time and inclination to.

Weekly grades will be assigned on a complete / not complete basis. 

Generally speaking, a project is due every week **before class**. If you are having trouble, please reach out for help via email or the class GroupMe ASAP. 

**Please contact me as far in advance as possible if you know you will have trouble submitting an assignment on time!**
