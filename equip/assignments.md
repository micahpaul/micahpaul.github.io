[Micah Hawkinson's Equip English Class, 2019-2020](readme.md)
---

**Analytical** Assignments should be about a page and a half long, typed and double-spaced. (Around 300-400 words.) You may respond one of the writing prompts or any other aspect of the week's readings that captured your attention.

For **Creative** Assignments, please take **at least** 30 minutes of **focused** time with no electronics, music, or distractions. Really focus on them. These aren't about volume so much as effort and quality. Work hard on them to strengthen your writing!

All readings can be accessed online using the links below, or you can get them in a [single PDF file here](equip_spring_2020.pdf).
