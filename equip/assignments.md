[Micah Hawkinson's EQUIP Programming, Fall 2024](readme.md)
---

This schedule shows the minimum work that must be completed during the semester. You may move more quickly and get more done if you have the time and inclination to.

Weekly grades will be assigned on a complete / not complete basis. 

Generally speaking, a project is due every week **by the end of class**. (Exceptions are clearly noted.) This will allow you to ask questions and fix any outstanding issues before I look at your project.

**Please contact me as far in advance as possible if you know you will have trouble submitting an assignment on time!**
