| 1/4/2019 | [*The Tempest*](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23042), William Shakespeare. [Act I, Scene 1](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/23042/23042-h/23042-h.htm#sceneI_1) - [Act II, Scene 2](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/23042/23042-h/23042-h.htm#sceneII_2) <br>• Give a portrait of one of the characters in the play. What do their lines and actions show us about their character? How do they relate to other characters? What motivates them? For example: Prospero, Miranda, Ferdinand, or Antonio.<br>• View the first couple of scenes in at least two different video versions. How do the productions differ? What choices did the different directors or producers make in staging them? How do these choices affect the audience's experience of the play? |
| 1/11/2019 | [*The Tempest*](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23042), William Shakespeare. [Act III, Scene 1](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/23042/23042-h/23042-h.htm#sceneIII_1) - [Act 5, Scene 1 and Epilogue](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/23042/23042-h/23042-h.htm#sceneV_1) (end) <br>• Either individually or with other class members, choose a scene from *The Tempest* to read in class. Target time: 3-5 minutes. The purpose is to see and hear these lines, which were really meant to be experienced live rather than simply read. <br>• Caliban and Ariel are interesting characters that share a lot in common but also are quite different. Discuss their similarities and differences. Why does Shakespeare include each of them in the play? And what does their presence imply about the island, if anything?<br>• Consider the fitness of various characters to rule. Which one would make the best ruler of a city, and why? Do you think Prospero would be a good duke? Discuss, using examples from the play. |
