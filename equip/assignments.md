Mencken, ["On Being an American"](http://monadnock.net/mencken/american.html) <br>James Baldwin, ["Notes of a Native Son"](https://www.whatsoproudlywehail.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Baldwin_Notes-of-a-Native-Son.pdf) <br>Wendell Berry, ["Compromise, Hell!"](https://orionmagazine.org/article/compromise-hell/) <br><br>**Analytical Essay <br>(Feel free to write about either of these prompts or anything else that interested you in the readings):**<br> • All three essays deal with the idea of being American, but they do it in extremely different ways. What details does each writer focus on? How do these details give us insight into each writer's concerns and themes? How do the details help define "Americanness"? Discuss at least one specific quote from each essay. <br> • Select two of the essays and contrast them with one another. Which one uses more humor? More seriousness? Why do you think each author selected the tone he did? What was he hoping to accomplish? Again, use specific quotes in your discussion. |

Which images did you think were most effective, and why? How can concrete images help us to understand truths that aren't visible or concrete? <br> • Khol and Clark clearly have different goals and aims in these texts. What do you think each of them is trying to accomplish, and why? Give specific examples to support your observatons. <br> • In Clark's essay, what does it mean to be "unuseful to God"? Why does he think this is "beautiful"? |

What physical, sensory details do White, Cummings, and Sanders provide to help us enter into their memories? Which of these details are most effective? Why? <br> • Does anything strike you as especially funny in these essays? Especially sad? Otherwise especially noteworthy? Why? How do these texts work to generate that feeling in you? <br> • Do any of these memoirs feel more or less honest or authentic to you than the others? What makes you feel that way about them? <br> • How does point of view affect the way the authors tell their memories and the way we read them? How does the point of view differ from text to text? |

Does he have any tricks or techniques that he uses to elicit laughs from his readers? <br> • All three of these pieces are a sort of observational humor. What types of things are they observing? How do their observations strike you, a reader who is separated from them by time and distance? Which of their observations resonate more strongly with you? <br> • This essay by Swift affects different readers in various ways. Some love it. Some hate it. Others are merely bored with it or horrified by it. What is it about the essay that would cause such varied responses? |
