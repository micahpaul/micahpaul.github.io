| Reflective Essay | 25% | Is the essay: <ul> <li>brief, <li>focused, <li>insightful, <li>linked to concrete examples from one or more of the stories we read, and <li> mechanically sound? |
| Plot |	20%	| Does the story have a clear, well-defined, self-contained plot? <br>Does it make sense? <br> Is it interesting without being utterly wild? <br> Is it free of unnecessary side-tracks? |
| Characters | 20% | Are the characters fully formed? <br> Can the reader see and hear them? <br> Do they talk and act in a believable (i.e., internally consistent) way? |
| Sensory Details | 25% | Can the reader see, smell, hear, taste, and/or touch this story? <br> Are there at least three different sensory details for each important person and place? <br> Are the sensory details specific enough to help us really experience the story? |
| Mechanics | 10% | Is the project free of spelling errors and non-standard grammar (unless done on purpose to help paint a character)? <br> Are the sentences clear, well-written, and no more complex than they need to be? <br> Is the paper formatted in MLA style? <br> Is the length within the window defined in the assignment? |
